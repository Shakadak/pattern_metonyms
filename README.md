# PatternMetonyms

Attempt at implementing Pattern Synonyms from [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pattern-synonyms-Haskell16.pdf](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pattern-synonyms-Haskell16.pdf) but obviously missing a ton of check, most notably from the type checker.

Consider this as a personal project project until 1.0.0, you may open issues, but pull requests will be closed without consideration.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `pattern_metonyms` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pattern_metonyms, "~> 0.4.0"}
  ]
end
```

The docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/pattern_metonyms](https://hexdocs.pm/pattern_metonyms).
