# PatternMetonyms

Attempt at implementing Pattern Synonyms from [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pattern-synonyms-Haskell16.pdf](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pattern-synonyms-Haskell16.pdf) but obviously missing a ton of check, most notably from the type checker.

Consider this as a personal project project until 1.0.0, you may open issues, but pull requests will be closed without check.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `pattern_metonyms` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pattern_metonyms, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/pattern_metonyms](https://hexdocs.pm/pattern_metonyms).
